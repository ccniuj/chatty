module Iodine

	# This is the Basic Iodine server unit - a network protocol.
	#
	# A new protocol instance will be created for every network connection.
	#
	# A new protocol might be initialized also when switching between protocols. In this use-case, the
	# protocol can be initialized with an optional second `options` parameter (the first parameter MUST be the IO object used),
	# allowing this data to be accessed within the {#on_open} method using the `@options` instance variable or the `options` accessor.
	#
	# For example, when switching protocols midstream (i.e. for implementing an Http Upgrade to another protocol such as Websockets):
	# 
	#      class MyNextProtocol
	#         def on_open
	#            @secret = options[:secret]
	#         end
	#      end
	#
	#      # in the old protocol:
	#
	#      class MyOriginalProtocol
	#         def switch_to_next_protocol
	#            MyNextProtocol.new @io, secret: "my secret data"
	#         end
	#      end
	#
	# The recommended use is to inherit this class and override any of the following:
	# on_open:: called whenever the Protocol is initialized. Override this to initialize the Protocol object.
	# on_message(data):: called whenever data is received from the IO. Override this to implement the actual network protocol.
	# on_close:: called AFTER the Protocol's IO is closed.
	# on_shutdown:: called when the server's shutdown process had started and BEFORE the Protocol's IO is closed. It allows graceful shutdown for network protocols.
	# ping:: called when timeout was reached. see {#set_timeout}
	#
	# Once the network protocol class was created, remember to tell Iodine about it:
	#       class MyProtocol << Iodine::Protocol
	#           # your code here
	#       end
	#       # tell Iodine
	#       Iodine.protocol = MyProtocol
	#
